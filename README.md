## Approach

- **Flutter** is used for cross-platform development..
- **Firebase** is initialized in `main.dart` for backend services.
- **ScreenUtil** ensures responsive layouts on all devices.
- **Google Fonts** provides custom typography.
- **SystemChrome** customizes the status bar for a modern look.
- The main UI starts from `Homepage`

This structure keeps code organized and scalable, making it easy to add features or screens as your app grows.
